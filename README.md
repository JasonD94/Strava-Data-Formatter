# Strava-Data-Formatter

This repo contains a Python script that can calculate the average milage biked
over the last few weeks (currently defined as 8 weeks arbitrarily)

This assumes you use Strava to track bike rides, and that you provide an "activities.csv"
file which can be exported from Strava if you request a copy of your data
